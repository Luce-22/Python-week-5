# Python-week-5
# Python Class Design and Polymorphism

## Description

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Python. It includes two parts:

**Part 1: Book Classes**
* Defines `Book` and `EBook` classes.
* `EBook` inherits from `Book`.
* Demonstrates encapsulation and polymorphism.

**Part 2: Animal Polymorphism**
* Defines animal classes (`Frog`, `Lion`, `Bat`, `Horse`).
* Each animal class has a `move()` method with unique behavior.
* Shows polymorphism through a common action with different implementations.
